# Gesture_Recognization_Project

Our project idea is to create a glove that reads hand signs and translates them into text and speech.
We are using flex sensors to measure finger bending moments and an accelerometer for hand movements.

Nowadays, almost everyone carries a smartphone, so to make this project portable and practical for daily use, we are utilizing a Bluetooth Module HC-05, this allows the detected hand signs to be displayed on a smartphone in both text and speech form.

In this repository, I will be open-sourcing all the code that we use to build this project.
